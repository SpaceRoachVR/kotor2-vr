/**
 * NotBlastable is a static template flag, and every static flag a save writes
 * back has to be written back, or a load quietly substitutes the class default.
 *
 * It was loaded from the template and never exported. Plot and Min1HP were
 * both, which is what made the omission invisible: doors came back from a save
 * correctly Plot-flagged and incorrectly blastable. In Peragus that turned
 * every "Emergency Blast Door" (NotBlastable=1) into a blastable one, and once
 * the mine route stopped being gated on Plot it offered a mine on all of them.
 *
 * This reads the source rather than exercising the exporter because
 * ModuleDoor/ModulePlaceable pull in the whole engine graph; the failure being
 * guarded against is a missing line, and a missing line is what this detects.

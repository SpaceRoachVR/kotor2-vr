/**
 * `ModuleCamera.save()` wrote three float properties as integer types:
 * FieldOfView as DWORD, Height as BYTE, Pitch as BYTE. None can hold what a
 * camera actually carries — a fractional FOV, a negative height, a negative
 * pitch — and `GFFField.setValue` reports the violation and stores the value
 * anyway, so the bad value reaches serialization and wraps. That is the same
 * -1/255 confusion that silently disabled every item property after a save/load
 * (see byte-field-sentinel.test.ts).
 *
 * The 82-module sweep caught it as
 * "Field.setValue BYTE OutOfBounds label='Height' value=-1.5" in 503OND. Every
 * camera in a saved module was affected, so cutscene framing did not survive a
 * save/load — which matters more here than upstream, since cutscenes are
 * reprojected onto a theater screen.
 *
 * ForgeCamera reads and writes all three as FLOAT in both directions, which is
 * what settles the authored types.

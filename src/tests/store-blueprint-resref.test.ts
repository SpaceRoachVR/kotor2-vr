/**
 * A GIT's StoreList struct names the store's blueprint `ResRef`. Every other
 * object type in a GIT names it `TemplateResRef`, and `ModuleStore.load()` mixed
 * the two: it guarded on `getResRef()` — the field a GIT store actually carries —
 * and then looked the UTM up with `getTemplateResRef()`, which a GIT store never
 * carries. `loadCachedResource` was therefore always handed null.
 *
 * The failure was total and silent. No store in the game loaded its blueprint,
 * so inventory, markUp/markDown, onOpenStore and locName all kept their
 * constructor defaults, and every merchant was empty. The 82-module sweep
 * reported "Failed to load ModuleStore template" in exactly the 12 of 82 modules
 * that contain a store, and in no module that does not — a 12/12 correlation is
 * what took this from a plausible reading of the source to a settled one.
 *
 * `ForgeStore` is the other half of the evidence: the project's own GIT reader
 * and writer moves this field through `ResRef` in both directions, which is what
 * settles which of the two names is the authored one.
